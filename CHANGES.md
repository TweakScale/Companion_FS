# TweakScale Companion :: Firespitter :: Changes

* 2020-0927: 1.1.0.0 (LisiasT) for KSP >= 1.3
	+ Getting rid of any lockdown on KSP 1.4, this thing now works on KSP 1.3 (as long your Firespitter does it too), taking advantage of the near future TweakScale 2.5 series.
	+ Refactoring using the new KSPe.Light.TweakScale v2.4 facilities to allow it to be safely installed on rigs without FS.
		- Lots of flexibility on packaging in the near future
